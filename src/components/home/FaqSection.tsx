    question: "Can I talk to landowners directly?",
    answer: "No, all proposals are mediated through YardMatters to ensure privacy and security for all parties. Our team facilitates communication after mutual interest is established."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the minimum land size required?",
    answer: "We typically work with land parcels of at least 0.5 acres, but exceptions can be made for high-value locations. Contact our team for specific requirements for your area."
  },
  {
    question: "Is YardMatters legally involved in the agreements?",
    answer: "YardMatters acts as a facilitator and provides templates, but is not a party to the final agreement. We recommend independent legal review before signing any documents."
  },
  {
    question: "How are my documents kept secure?",
    answer: "All documents are encrypted and stored in compliance with ISO 27001 standards. They are only accessible to our verification team and are never shared directly with third parties."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the typical collaboration process take?",
    answer: "The timeline varies depending on project complexity, but typically takes 3-6 months from initial listing to formal agreement signing."
